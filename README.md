# Monosyllabic-Vowel-Detection
*attention* This was the very first project I did after getting introduced to python and programming in general, so of course it isn't the cleanest code. I keep it here to eventually pick up the porject again and fully flesh out my ideas for it.
(WIP) Segments and annotates vowels in monosyllabic words to a textgrid from normalized .wav files. Vowels are detected using intensity.
Utilizes Christian's Python Library.
